## Example JSON Schemas

Here are a few example JSON schemas you might interact with in this project.

### 1. **Example JSON for User Data**

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Example JSON for AI Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Data processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "result": {
      "prediction": 0.85,
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Example JSON for Schema Definition**

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "age": {
        "type": "number"
      }
    },
    "required": ["name", "age"]
  }
}
```

These JSON examples represent typical data structures that this frontend will interact with, including user data, AI responses, and JSON schema definitions.
